# <random-password-generator>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to put together a solution to having to come up with strong passwords. I was also looking to practice my javaScript logic and syntax. Through this project I am more confident using for loops, if/else statement and how to put together functional javaScript logic.

## Usage

Simply click on the 'Generate Password' button, then follow the prompts for which types of characters to include in password. Password length should be between 10-64 characters. Upon completion new password option will be available to copy.

## Credits

Mentor Support: Drew and classmates have provided invaluable assistance throughout the project, offering guidance and clearing doubts whenever needed.
